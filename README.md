Master's Thesis under Profressor Steve Easterbrook in the Department of Computer Science at the University of Toronto.

My first thesis topic was "Is The Internet Green?", which I have included in this repository for reference. However, during revisions I ended up scrapping my original thesis and changed it to "Moore's Law: Can Exponential Growth of ICT be Sustained on a Finite Planet?". Fortunately, this version was approved :)
